Big O Notation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgLTDT03QtU
Hashmap - O ( 1 ) 
Binary Search, Binary Search Tree - O (logN) - data set to iterate divided by 2 - Near O(1)
Example factorial, using hashamp to store found values - O(Square Root Of N) Rare - Near O( N )
1 loop - O(N)
Merge Sort, Heap Sort - (N logN) - Build Heap N, Heap Sort LogN
Nested Loop - O ( N square ) - Matrix 2X3 (MXN) equivalent to N Square
N! - Permutations, Sometimes in Graph(Travelling Salesman Problem)
